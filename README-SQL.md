## üìò SQL Basics

### 1. Query Structure & Clauses
- `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`
- `WHERE`: `NOT IN`, `NULL`, `<>`
- Aggregate Functions: `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `COUNT()`
- Conditional: `IF`, `IFNULL(expr, val)`, `CASE WHEN`
- NULL Handling: `COALESCE()`
- `DISTINCT`

![sql](docs/sql-1.png)

**Duplicates**:

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM students
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Left Anti Join**:
 
```sql
SELECT a.* FROM a
LEFT JOIN b ON a.key = b.key
WHERE b.key IS NULL;
```

### 2. Joins & Subqueries
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`

## üßÆ SQL Advanced Aggregation & Window Functions

### 3. Window Function Basics
- `PARTITION BY`, `ORDER BY` in `OVER()` clause
- Ranking: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
- Analytics: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` over windows
- Lag/Lead: `LAG()`, `LEAD()` to access previous/next rows
- First/Last: `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`

#### Example:
```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date)
LAG(txn_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date)
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª SQL Classic Use Cases

### 4. Daily Average Spend > 3
```sql
SELECT customer_id, AVG(daily_sum) AS average_spend
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, txn_date, SUM(txn_amount) AS daily_sum
    FROM transaction
    GROUP BY customer_id, txn_date
) daily_spend
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING AVG(daily_sum) > 3;
```

### 5. Average Days Between Transactions
```sql
-- Step 1: Get previous transaction date
WITH transaction_date AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        txn_date,
        LAG(txn_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS prev_transaction_date
    FROM 
        transaction
)

-- Step 2: Calculate days between transactions
, date_diff AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        DATEDIFF(txn_date, prev_transaction_date) AS date_between_transactions
    FROM transaction_date
    WHERE prev_transaction_date IS NOT NULL
)

-- Step 3: Calculate average days between transactions
SELECT
    customer_id,
    AVG(date_between_transactions) AS avg_days_transactions
FROM date_diff
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 6. Top 10 Spenders in Last 30 Days
```sql
SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spend
FROM transactions
WHERE tx_time >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), 30)
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 7. Consecutive 3-Day Logins ‚úÖ

```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date)
```

| user\_id | login\_date | rn | flag\_date |
| -------- | ----------- | -- | ---------- |
| A        | 2025-01-01  | 1  | 2024-12-31 |
| A        | 2025-01-02  | 2  | 2024-12-31 |
| A        | 2025-01-03  | 3  | 2024-12-31 |
| A        | 2025-01-05  | 4  | 2025-01-01 |
| B        | 2025-01-02  | 1  | 2025-01-01 |
| B        | 2025-01-04  | 2  | 2025-01-02 |
| B        | 2025-01-05  | 3  | 2025-01-03 |
| B        | 2025-01-06  | 4  | 2025-01-04 |

```sql
WITH flags AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id, 
        login_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date) AS rn,
        DATE_SUB(login_date, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date)) AS flag_date
    FROM logins
),
segments AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id, 
        flag_date, 
        COUNT(*) AS cnt,
        MIN(login_date) AS start_date,
        MAX(login_date) AS end_date
    FROM flags
    GROUP BY user_id, flag_date
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
)
SELECT * FROM segments;
```

| user\_id | flag\_date | cnt | start\_date | end\_date  |
| -------- | ---------- | --- | ----------- | ---------- |
| A        | 2024-12-31 | 3   | 2025-01-01  | 2025-01-03 |
| B        | 2025-01-04 | 3   | 2025-01-04  | 2025-01-06 |

## üîÅ Retention & Rolling Behavior

### 10. Seller 30-Day Retention Rate
```sql
WITH prev_txn AS (
  SELECT 
      seller_id, 
      transaction_date,
      LAG(transaction_date) OVER (PARTITION BY seller_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS prev_date
  FROM transactions
)
SELECT 
    transaction_date,
    COUNT(seller_id) AS total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(transaction_date, prev_date) <= 30 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS retained,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(transaction_date, prev_date) <= 30 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(seller_id), 2) AS rate
FROM 
    prev_txn
GROUP BY 
    transaction_date;
```

**Sample Table: `transactions`**

| seller_id | transaction_date |
|-----------|------------------|
